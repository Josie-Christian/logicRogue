# The Encounter (as understood for us as Developers)

## Winning Condition

The player will win the Encounter (defeat the enemy) when the logical sentence that the creature
holds as a challenge to the player character has been successfully derived in the KM-ish proof framework.
This means that the natural deduction has ended, either by Conculsion, Consequent, or Contradiction.

## Encounter Natural Deduction Mechanic

The player will be presented with a logical sentence to prove by the enemy. The premises (sentences given
for free) will be in the inventory of the player to use during the Encounter. They will "attack"
by selecting from the rules they know as buttons labeled with the appropriate rule.

Button press will signal the player to select 1 or two sentences (from inventory)
to apply the rule to. If the rule is able
to be applied to the sentences selected, the player will be shown the conclusion that would be produced
by the use of that rule on those sentences. The sentence produced will go into the player inventory.
